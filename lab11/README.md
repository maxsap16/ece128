### Project Description
The purpose of this lab was to learn how to utilize the hardware block creation that Vivado IP offers for implementing various verilog designs. Although there are many designs that this tool is capable of generating, this lab only required that we create an adder.

### Implementation Instructions
1. After your block diagrams, source code, and testbenches are generated by Vivado IP, run the synthesis of your code to make sure there are no errors.
2. Then locate the dropdown on the left where you can run a behavioral simulation and observe the waveform diagrams. Although the testbench was created by Vivado IP, an adder is a very simple design whose functionality should be easliy verified.
3. If everything seems to be in order, then this lab is done since there is no physical implementation.
