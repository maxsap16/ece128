### Project Description
The main purpose of this lab is to learn about and identify the differences between Random Access Memory (RAM) and Read-Only Memory (ROM) through the design of an 8x8 RAM (8 locations with read/write data size 8 bits) and 8x4 ROM (8 locations with read-only data size 4 bits). The use of testbenches is optimal to see how both of these modules access and/or store information.

### Implementation Instructions
1. After the source code and testbench files are written, run the synthesis of your code to make sure there are no errors.
2. Then, locate the dropdown on the left where you can run a behavioral simulation and observe the waveform diagram. Make sure you are familiar with how both of these designs track data so you can accurately verify the functionality of your code.
3. If both modules appear to be operating correctly then the lab is over since there are no designs to be physically implemented this lab.
